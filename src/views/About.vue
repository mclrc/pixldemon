      I'm currently in high school and will be for another two years.
      Once I graduate, I plan to spend at least a year or two in a foreign country, probably Canada, travelling and getting to know new people.
      Maybe I'll try to get a scholarship and study abroad, too. In any case, I want to study some combination of computer science, software
      engineering and political science.

      I could tell you what I think I'll want to do after, but it's almost certain to change until then. What I am reasonably sure about is that 
      I will try to pursue a career in software engineering, which has been a dream of mine for close to half my lifetime now.

      Software and programming have always fascinated me, since way before I really understood anything about them. Originally, I wanted to create 
      my own games, or improve the ones I loved. So when one day, I was lucky enough to stumble upon
      an advert for a programming book for children in a magazine my grandmother had bought me, ten-or-so year old me 
      was smart enough to say hey, lets give it a shot. My dad gladly bought me the book, and so here we are, with programming being by far
      my biggest passion in life.
